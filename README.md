# Weather Widget

I started this project as a way to challenge and re-kindle some of my React skills, whilst also learning how to navigate and handle API calls and display data as seperate UI elements.

What I learnt:

- Seperation of concerns. I stored pieces of data in their own state, each state had their own corresponding useEffect hook which was re-called whenever a new data object was served up by the API.
- How to make an API call, and display that data as seperate UI elements. 
- How to differentiate and utilise both stateful and stateless componenets. 
- How to manage props and pass props down through components.
